# GameUpQt

This QML plugin written in C++ to help Qt/QML developers adopt GameUp server (http://gameup.io) features in your Qt/QML based game
The code is intended to be multiplatform. No any platform specific code was used and no plans to use

Since the code is written at spare time, not all features from GameUp implemented at the moment. Gimme a mail with your wishes
